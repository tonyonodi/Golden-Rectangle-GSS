# Golden Rectangle

Just a quick experiment to make a [golden rectangle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio) web page layout using the extremely exciting [GSS library](http://gridstylesheets.org/). Nothing exciting, if you'd like to run it make sure you have [middleman](http://middlemanapp.com) installed, clone the repo and run or build in the usual way.
